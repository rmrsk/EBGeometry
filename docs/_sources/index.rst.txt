Welcome to EBGeometry's documentation!
======================================

This is the developer documentation for EBGeometry.
EBGeometry is a small C++ package for computing signed distance fields from surface tesselations.
Although it is a self-contained package, it is was originally written for usage with embedded boundary (EB) codes.

This documentation is the user documentation for EBGeometry.
A separate Doxygen-generated API of EBGeometry is found `here <doxygen/html/index.html>`_.
