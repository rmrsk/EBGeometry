.. _Chap:Examples:

Below, we consider a few examples that show how to use ``EBGeometry``.
All the examples are located in the :file:`Examples` folder.
For instructions on how to compile and run the examples, refer to the README file in the example folder.

EBGeometry
==========

``EBGeometry``-specified examples are given in :file:`Examples/EBGeometry_<something>`.
These examples display most of the ``EBGeometry`` functionality:

* Generating analytic implicit or signed distance functions.
* Representation of surface grids as signed distance functions.
* Using BVH-acceleration when combining multiple analytically defined implicit functions with CSG.
* Using BVH-acceleration when combining multiple surface grids functions with CSG.  

Note that these examples do not provide any output for visualization.

AMReX
=====

The AMReX examples are given in :file:`Examples/AMReX_<something>`.
These examples are intended to expose the same features as the ``EBGeometry``-specific examples.

Chombo3
=======

The Chombo-3 examples are given in :file:`Examples/Chombo3_<something>`.
These examples are intended to expose the same features as the ``EBGeometry``-specific examples.
