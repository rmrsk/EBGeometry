\doxysection*{Doxygen documentation}

To build the doxygen documentation locally, run


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{doxygen doxyfile}
\end{DoxyCode}


in this folder. This will install the doxygen documentation in the {\ttfamily doxygen} subfolder.

\doxysection*{Manual build}

We use Sphinx with re\+Structured text for building the user documentation. To build the documentation locally, navigate to the Sphinx subfolder and run


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd Sphinx}
\DoxyCodeLine{make html}
\end{DoxyCode}


for the H\+T\+ML documentation and


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd Sphinx}
\DoxyCodeLine{make latexpdf}
\end{DoxyCode}


for the La\+Te\+X/\+P\+DF documentation.

Source files will end up in {\ttfamily Sphinx/build/html} and {\ttfamily Sphinx/build/latex}, respectively.

\doxysection*{Adding Sphinx changes.}

To add changes to the Sphinx documentation, make the changes in the relevant Sphinx/source files. To build the documentation, either build it locally as above or put Sphinx in auto-\/build mode\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd Sphinx}
\DoxyCodeLine{sphinx-\/autobuild source/ build/html}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will start a server at \href{http://127.0.0.1:8000}{\texttt{ http\+://127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:8000}} and start watching for changes in the {\ttfamily source} directory. When a change is detected, the documentation is rebuilt and any open browser windows are reloaded automatically. {\ttfamily Keyboard\+Interrupt} ({\ttfamily ctrl}+{\ttfamily c}) will stop the server.
